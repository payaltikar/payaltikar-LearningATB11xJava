//        Java does not support multiple inheritance (where a class can inherit from more than one parent class) to avoid the "diamond problem" and keep the language simple and maintainable.
//
//                Why No Multiple Inheritance in Java?
//                Diamond Problem (Ambiguity Issue)
//
//        If a class inherits from two parent classes that have the same method, Java wouldnâ€™t know which one to call.
